# closestAirport
Find the closest airport from your location using this app.

Uses Great Circle distance or orthodromic distance to calculate the distance to the closest airport from your location.
This means it takes into consideration the curvature of the earth and does not find the airport based on a straight line distance through the surface of the earth.

Also uses bubble sort to filter through the big airport list and makes the algorithm faster performance wise.

You need a airport list in the location of the code and need to change the name of file of the list in the code.
Or you can name your airport data file as 'airports.dat' which is what the code tries to open to read.
